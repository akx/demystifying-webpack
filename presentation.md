# Demystifying Webpack
Turku ‚ù§ Frontend
26 April 2017

## Hello! üëã
* I'm Aarni Koskela (@akx)
* I've been writing code since I was about 6 years old
* ... and doing web stuff since IE 6 was a Good Thing
* Now working at Valohai on a cutting-edge machine learning infrastructure SaaS (that's a mouthful)


## A Disclaimer

* I'm not going to cover all the more advanced features Webpack supports in this presentation.
* Juho VepsaÃàlaÃàinen (@bebraw) has a book and a presentation on that! https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack
 
## And by the way

* Please feel free to interrupt at any time!

## So, what is Webpack anyway?

Webpack is a module bundler (like its predecessor Browserify)

It . . .

* takes one or more files (primarily, but not only, JavaScript)
* transforms them
* produces one or more bundle files (again, primarily but not necessarily only JavaScript)

## Why Webpack?

* If you want to use ES6/JSX syntax in all browsers (e.g. using Babel or BubleÃÅ)
* If you want to optimize and minify your code before delivering it to clients (built-in!)
* If you want nicer encapsulation and componentization (CSS within your bundle, for instance)
* If you want live code reloading (lovely for development)

## But isn't Webpack impossible to configure?

* That's the myth!
* Webpack is pretty easy to get going with (with a basic configuration)
* Of course, more complex configurations (splitting, per-module hot reloading, ...) get more complicated

## Let's do this!

Let's set up a simple SPA (single page application) from scratch with

* Webpack
* React
* Stylus-based stylesheets (could just as well be SASS/SCSS or LESS)
* Photos of cats, because of course :)

(in reality, you might want to start something like this using create-react-app, but for the sake of practice...)

## First: installing stuff!

The packages we need are:
* webpack (duh)
* react (React itself)
* react-dom (React's browser interface)
* file-loader (allows `require`ing binary files)
* style-loader (injects <style> tags for CSS)
* css-loader (loads and minifies CSS)
* stylus-loader (loads Stylus style sheets)
* stylus (a dependency of stylus-loader)
* babel-loader (Webpack loader for Babel)
* babel-core (Babel's core without a CLI)
* babel-preset-env (a general ES6 Babel preset)
* babel-preset-react (a Babel preset for React)

Also, for development, let's install

* webpack-dev-server (development server)

## Yarrrrn!

* `yarn init`
* `yarn add webpack react react-dom url-loader file-loader style-loader css-loader stylus-loader stylus babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-react babel-preset-env`
* `yarn add --dev webpack-dev-server`

We could just as well use npm, but yarn is faster.

## Second: the configuration!

Webpack can be run without a configuration file, but no one does that.

* Webpack is configured by way of a JavaScript configuration file, by default webpack.config.js.
* The configuration file is Real, Actual JavaScript, which will be executed by Node.js, so you can do whatever you like in it, as long as you `module.exports =` a configuration object at the end.
* We'll just keep it reasonably simple for now...

### Simplest configuration

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
};
```

This won't do anything fancy since no loaders are set But it'll bundle things and let us to use `require()` already!

## Let's write some code!

This is src/index.js, our entry point. 

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

document.write('herlo worl');
```

 
## Let's rev up the dev server!

Let's add an incantation to open the dev server to our `package.json` file, so it's easier to start now and later.

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server"
  }
```

Now all we need to do is `yarn dev` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/bundle ‚Äì a virtual HTML file that loads our bundle

## Let's add loaders!

Anything other than plain JavaScript must be transformed by way of loaders; we've already installed a bunch of them, so let's configure them...

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /.styl$/,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'stylus-loader'],
    },
    {
      test: /.(jpg|jpeg|png)$/,
      use: ['file-loader'],
    },
    {
      test: /.jsx?$/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['env', 'react'],
        },
      },
      exclude: /node_modules/,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Let's write some React!

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import CatImageURL from './cat.png';

class CatApp extends React.Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {number: 1};
	}
	render() {
		const cats = [];
		for(let i = 0; i < this.state.number; i++) {
			cats.push(<img src={CatImageURL} key={i} />);
		}
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Cat app</h1>
				<button onClick={(e) => this.setState({number: this.state.number + 1})}>More mew!</button>
				<br />
				{cats}
			</div>
		);
	}
}

ReactDOM.render(<CatApp />, document.body);
```

Note how any edits reload the application in real time! üòé
 
## Let's also add some style!

Since style-loader supports hot reloading, so we can tweak styles even faster!
(That is, if we're running the dev server with --hot)

```javascript
import style from './style.styl';
```

## We're done developing,  let's go to production!

* The -p (for production) flag to webpack (the CLI tool) enables minification and other optimizations
* The --progress flag lets us watch exciting things happen
* So let's run: `./node_modules/.bin/webpack -p --progress`
* And lo and behold; there's a bundle.js and a PNG file in dist/
* Look ma, no CSS file though! (It's embedded in the JS bundle.)
* You can serve the built files with any old web server, and/or embed them in your apps.

## That's it!

Simple, no?

Thank you!  Questions?
